## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
The main idea of the problem statement is to develop a user-friendly website that helps people locate the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities. The website should also provide educational information about the harmful components of e-waste and the environmental and health risks associated with improper disposal. Additionally, the site should allow users to enter the model of their old electronic devices to estimate and earn credit points based on the precious metals that can be recovered from these devices when disposed of correctly. This solution aims to promote proper e-waste disposal through awareness and incentives.
